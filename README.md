# Student Performance Analysis using Python
This project focuses on analyzing student academic performance using Python. The dataset includes information such as gender, attendance, weekly study hours, and grade categories. Data analysis techniques are applied to study how these factors influence student performance.

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes student academic performance using Python.
The goal is to understand how factors such as weekly study hours,
attendance, and gender influence students' grades.
The project uses data analysis and visualization techniques to
extract meaningful insights from the dataset.

This project is developed as a basic Data Science mini project
suitable for Artificial Intelligence and Data Science (AIDS) students.
